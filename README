One Tough Puzzle
================

This is a project to come up with an efficient solution to solving One Tough Puzzle (TM).

Right now the solution is set to iterate over all possibilities and find the correct solution that way.  In the future I plan on either rewriting this in other languages and/or making it more efficient.  This is just a fun personal project.
