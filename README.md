# Puzzles


##Introduction
I am using this project as a way to write various programs that solve puzzles.  This can include physical ones, such as the one tough puzzle, or simple CS problems.

Puzzle might not be the most descriptive name as I might also have files in here for simple CS practice problems.

Right now problems I have done / would like to do include:
- One Tough Puzzle (done)
- Sudoku
- Tic-Tac-Toe
